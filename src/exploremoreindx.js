          <h3>Veterinary Wellness Exams</h3>
          <p>
            How well do you know your pet? Is your pet less active, agitated, or
            gaining weight recently? Just like the case of humans, there are
            different diseases and ailments that can affect the health of your
            loving pet. It is important to take your pet for a routine health
            checkup at least once a year. With a comprehensive wellness exam
            from Pet Trust, take timely preventive measures and ensure that your
            pets are always at the best of health.

          <h3>Flea and Tick Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            Fleas and ticks are common problems encountered by every pet owner.
            These can grow into infestations that spread and can affect both
            pets and humans. If you see your pets scratching and biting or you
            see fleas, bring them to your vets at Pet Trust to get rid of them
            immediately.
